# Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble sort :
#### -> repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
#### -> worst/avg time complexity : o(n)
#### -> auxiliary space - o(1)
#### -> sorting in place - yes
#### -> stable - yes

### Selection sort :
#### -> sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
#### -> time complexity  : o(n^2)
#### -> sorting in place - yes

### Insertion sort :
#### works the way we sort playing cards in our hands
#### -> time complexity  : o(n^2)
#### -> sorting in place - yes
#### -> auxiliary space - o(1)
