# Sorting Algorithms
### Bubble sort :
* repeatedly swaps the adjacent elements if they are in wrong order.
* worst/avg time complexity : o(n)
* auxiliary space - o(1)
* sorting in place - yes
* stable - yes

### Selection sort :
* sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning
* time complexity  : o(n^2)
* sorting in place - yes

### Insertion sort :
* works the way we sort playing cards in our hands
* time complexity  : o(n^2)
* sorting in place - yes
* auxiliary space - o(1)

### Merge sort :
* divide and conquer paradigm
* time complexity  : o(nLogn) in all cases 
* sorting in place - no
* stable - yes

### Quick sort :
* divide and conquer paradigm
* picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot
* time complexity  : o(nLogn) in best/avg case ; o(n^2) in worst case 
* sorting in place - yes
* stable - no

### Counting sort :
* Time Complexity: O(n+k)
